		<h1> Memphis weather prediction algorithm <h1/>
		<p>
		I have made a weather prediction algorithm that predicts the maximum temperature in Memphis<br>
		I did this by following Brandon Rohrer's course End-to-end data science: Time-series prediction<br>
		To predict the temprature I used the autocorrelation of one day's temprature to the next. Autocorrelation is when the data at a previous timesteps is useful for predicting at a future timestep.<br>
		The data had an Autocorrelation of .9. The data was from 1960 to 2018. I got the data from www.ncdc.noaa.gov.<br>
		I had to prepare the data by getting rid of missing values, seperating the data into maximum temprature and dates, and fixing some other minor bugs.<br>
		In the end I achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 8.4. I'm planning to create a random forest model and turn it into an ios app using CoreML.<br>
