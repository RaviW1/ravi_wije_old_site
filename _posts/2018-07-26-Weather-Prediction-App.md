I have converted my Random Forest Algorithm into an ios app using CoreML.
I followed Brian Advent's LinkedIn course, iOS App Development: Core ML, to convert my model.
I also followed [Matt Mathias' tutorial.](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/machine-learning-in-ios-using-core-ml/)
Using both of the courses it was fairly easy to create an app event though I ran into a lot of bugs in Xcode.
This was my first programming in Swift and was difficult at first.
In the end I was able to make a fully functioning app that predicted the weather in Memphis.
