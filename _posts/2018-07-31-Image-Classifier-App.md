title: "Mushroom Image Classifier iOS App"

I made a iOS app that can detect if an image has a mushroom in it.
I followed [Jameson Toole's tutorial.](https://hackernoon.com/building-not-hotdog-with-turi-create-and-core-ml-in-an-afternoon-231b14738edf)
I built the model in Python using Turi Create. I also used Vision and CoreML to convert it into an app.
The project wasn't too hard and only took a couple of days.
The app works pretty well and has a 95.7% accuracy.


Images of the app:
