I have created a new random forest weather prediction model using sklearn.
It can predict the weather of Memphis with a MAE of 4.44 and an accuracy of 92.72%.
A random forest is a model that uses tons of decision trees to make a prediction.
So for tommorrow which is June 7th 2018 the model predicts a max temprature of 90 degrees fahrenheit.
I got the data from www.ncdc.noaa.gov.
