### Weather Prediction Algorithm

In this project I used 50 years of memphis weather data to make a autocorrelation model that could predict the max temperature three days in to the future. The mean absulute error was 8.4

### Random Forest Weather Algorithm

This project was similar to the weather prediction algorithm, however, instead of a autocorrelation model this used a random forest algorithm. Also unlike the autocorrelation model this model predicted the temperature of the next day and had a mean absolute error of 4.44.

### Weather Prediction App

In this project I took the random forest model and, using CoreML, converted it into a iOS app.

### Mushroom Image Classifier App

In this project I made an iOS app that could detect if an image had a mushroom in it. I built the model in Python using Turi Create and I used CoreML to convert it into an app. The model has a 95.7% accuracy.
