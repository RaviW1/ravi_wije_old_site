I have not been good about updating my blog. This year I want to try to be better at this.
Throughout the year, I have been taking on small projects. During the school year, I attempted to complete two courses. These courses were by Brandon Rohrer, whose courses you can find [here](https://end-to-end-machine-learning.teachable.com/). The first one was a decision tree which predicted arrival times of the subway in Boston.

I achieved very good results in the end with a pretty accurate model.
The second course I took was a polynomial classifier that, when given the name of a dog breed, gives similarly sized dog breeds.
