It's been a while since I've updated the blog and this year I'm going to better about updating it.
In the meantime I've updated the entirety of the blog. Instead of using Jekyll I am now using Hugo and R to power the website. My website is no longer on Github, I have switched over to Netlify. I was having trouble getting the website to run on Github and Netlify proved to be far easier. The use of Hugo templates allows the blog to look alot better and more professional.
