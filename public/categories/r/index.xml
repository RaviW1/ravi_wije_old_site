      <description>Background This is the third post in a short series about the first course I taught as a new assistant teaching professor at UCSD - COGS 9 : Introduction to Data Science.
To see earlier posts:
 Part I - discusses what went well &amp;amp; and what went less well Part II - breaks down what students thought of and learned from the course based on data they provided and how they did in the course.</description>

      <title>Part II: My Students’ Thoughts In Data</title>

      <description>Background I previously wrote Part I in this short series describing my first course here at UCSD, specifically focusing on three things than went well…and three that went er not so well. Now, as I sit in the time period after having submitted final grades but before having access to student evaluations, I wanted to take a few minutes to draft a few posts using the data I collected from students throughout the course to tell a short story about what they, en masse, thought of the course.</description>

      <title>Will You Be A Halloween Hero Or The Neighborhood Dud?</title>

      <description>Now that we’re knee-deep into October, leaves are falling, temperatures are cooling, PSLs are flowing from Starbucks like water, and Halloween candy has completely taken over seasonal aisles in grocery stores across the country, it’s time for you to decide what candy to buy for trick-or-treaters.
Sure, you could take an economic approach and just get whatever’s cheapest (if you’re a grad student, I fully support this route), or you could just as well take an approach to give the people what they want!</description>

      <title>The Emotional Curve of Every Project</title>

      <description>I was on a long flight again recently. Long flights are theoretically great times to get a lot of work done, but have historically only resulted in me getting caught up on podcasts, reading books, and/or drawing a cartoon or two. I imagine this is something that will have to change over my career if the amount of travel increases, but that&#39;s a future Shannon problem.
As for right now, on my recent long flight, I realized that every project I&#39;ve ever completed has gone through three main phases:</description>

      <title>Analyzing Sexual Harassment in Higher Education (Part 1)</title>
      <link>/blog/analyzing-sexual-harassment-in-higher-education-part-1/</link>

      <description>2017 has taught us a lot. Among the many lessons, it has taught us (or maybe more accurately, reminded most of us) that sexual harassment is rampant. While Hollywood and politicians are most heavily under fire at this moment, to think that sexual harassment doesn&#39;t happen in one&#39;s own discipline would simply be naive. As an academic, I was happy to hear that The Chronicle of Higher Education was looking into cases of sexual harassment in higher education to hopefully change the field for the better.</description>

      <title>Inclusive Analysis of Gender Diversity Among Data Scientists</title>

      <description>Abdul Majed Raja recently wrote a nice post analyzing gender diversity within the Kaggle Survey data. This survey, which ran from August 7th to August 25th of 2017, was an “industry-wide survey to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning” with data from 16,716 participants.
Here, I extend Abdul’s work to include responses from participants who did not identify as male or female. This is not a critique of the initial work.</description>

      <description>Let me start off by acknowledging that we are by no means the first people to ask which color palettes are best for graphing. Further, I fully admit that we entered into this quickly and did not read the literature thoroughly nor think through all the possibilities that one should consider when embarking upon a proper research project. Which, to be fair, is why this is a blog post (and not a paper).</description>
